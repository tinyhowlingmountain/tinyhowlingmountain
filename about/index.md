    <p>At present, I am in the mathematics department at the University of Vermont, where I am completing a masters in applied math. In addition to fundamentals in analysis, I concentrate on employing numerical analysis and ordinary differential equations techniques to applied math settings, including Time Series and Network Research. I also hold a teaching assistantship position in the department, instructing Calculus 019 Sections, and assisting with Real Analysis and Linear Algebra. </p>

<p markdown="1">Previously, I completed a core curriculum in engineering and a thesis on Freshwater Hydrology and Riparian Conservation Methodologies at Hampshire College. In a surprising turn of events, positions in applied computer science at the University of Massachusetts Department of Physics and The Rubenstein School of Natural Resources at UVM fueled my interest in thinking deeply about pure math.
